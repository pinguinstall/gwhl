Documentation:
- Source code API docs
- Handbook

Functionality:
- crazy indexing schemes to linear arrays
- sparse matrix functionality
- MPI based distributed sorting on too-large-for-one datasets

Code:
- separate code more clearly by function, most source files are rather big atm

Tests:
- write meaningful automated tests which are invoked by "make check" and
  automatically respond with SUCCESS or FAILED
- improve test coverage, ideally every function
