The "Gravitational Wave Helper Lib" is a very basic math library with flat data types.

Some basic numeric routines are present:
- basic 3d vector BLAS 1,2,3, with non-standard interfaces
- a basic Cholesky solver (described in Lindegren, L.; Lammers, U.; Hobbs, D.; O'Mullane, W.; Bastian, U.; Hern√°ndez, J.: "The astrometric core solution for the Gaia mission", Appendix C [https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4139])
- extremely fast and stable computation of associated Legendre polynomials 
- unit conversion functions
- some quaternion routines (rotation, normalization, ...)
- routines to compute spherical harmonics
- rotation matrices
- routines computing vector spherical harmonics (see F. Mignard and S. Klioner: Analysis of astrometric catalogues with vector spherical harmonics [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2012/11/aa19927-12/aa19927-12.html])

All routines have in common that they work on most basic data-types: linear double arrays instead of a special struct for vectors or matrices. That makes the code quite "compiler friendly" and hence fast.

This library is work in progress: no API stability is guaranteed, features can be added and removed at any time, no completeness nor correctness is guaranteed.
