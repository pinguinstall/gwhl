This is the Gravitational Wave Helper Lib (GWHL)

A very simple and fast, math library (not only) for gravitational wave (GW)
science using raw C data types.
GWHL is developed alongside GaiaGW, the VSH-based GW detection pipeline for
the ESA Gaia mission.
The goal of GWHL is to keep the routines as simple as possible, not to provide
the best API, error handling or elegance of code.

  This library has been partly developed during projects financially supported by
  ESA under grant 4000115263/15/NL/IB and the BMWi grant 50QG1402 awarded by the DLR.
  
Installation:
  - Make sure you have an installation of GNU GSL >= 2.7
  - Make sure you have an MPI-2 compatible Version of OpenMPI.
    (other MPI Implementations might work as well, not tested)
  - Modifiy "Makefile" according to your need, important is the GSL-path
  - make clean && make
  - If you wish make check ... the tests are not running and are more like a
    dev feature right now
  - Copy "include/" and "libGWHelper.so" to desired location
